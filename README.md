# DSA Classes and Practice

A repository for Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) learning, class-based notes, and practice problems in Java. This is my personal collection of assignments, examples, and practice questions.

## 📁 Repository Structure

DSA-Classes-Practice/
│
├── Assignment‑Questions/ # DSA / algorithm assignments given in class
├── Learning‑DSA‑Classes/ # Theory, class notes, explanations of DSA topics
├── Practice‑Questions/ # Self-practice problems, code solutions
├── .gitignore
├── DSA-Classes-Practice.iml
└── README.md


- **Assignment‑Questions**: Contains assignments or tasks given during class sessions.
- **Learning‑DSA‑Classes**: Notes, slides or theory explanations of data structures & algorithms topics.
- **Practice‑Questions**: Problems you attempt on your own, with solution code in Java.
- **DSA-Classes-Practice.iml** & other project files: IDE configuration files (you may ignore them in documentation).

## 🧠 What You’ll Find Here

- Java implementation of common data structures (arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, graphs, etc.)
- Algorithm solutions: sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, greedy, backtracking, etc.
- Practice problems (coding challenges) along with your solution files.
- Notes and explanations of DSA concepts from class.

## 💡 Sample Code Snippets

Here’s a simple example (pseudocode / Java style) from your practice suite:

```java
public int binarySearch(int[] arr, int target) {
    int left = 0, right = arr.length - 1;
    while (left <= right) {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] == target) {
            return mid;
        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    return -1; // not found
}


✅ How to Use / Run

To use or test the code:

1.Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/sandeepmehra28/DSA-Classes-Practice.git


2.Open it in an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / VS Code (Java support).

3.Navigate to a practice or assignment package, find the main or test method, and run the Java code.

4.You can add your own problems, create additional classes or algorithms, and test them.


🎯 Roadmap & Future Enhancements

-Here are some ideas to grow this repo further:

-Add unit tests (JUnit) for your algorithm functions.

-Benchmark performance (time / memory) for large inputs.

-Add more algorithm topics (e.g. advanced graph algorithms, segment tree, tries, DP on trees).

-Add documentation / markdown files with theory diagrams, flowcharts, visualizations.

-Use a consistent package structure, e.g. com.sandeepmehra.dsa.{arrays,linkedlist,trees}.

-Add a results / stats dashboard (e.g. how many problems solved, categories, difficulty).


📌 Tips for Contributors / Self

-Always comment your code — explaining complexity, edge cases.

-Use meaningful variable and class names.

-Before coding, write down the approach in comments or paper.

-Practice consistency: one style, proper indentation, modular functions.

-Use version control well — commit often with meaningful messages.
